=head1 NAME

Bio::Tools::ProteinogenicAA - The great new Bio::Tools::ProteinogenicAA!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use Bio::Tools::ProteinogenicAA;

    my $p = Bio::Tools::ProteinogenicAA->new();
    
    #recover the amino acids list from the object
    my @aas = @{$p->aminoacids};

    say $aas[0]->short_name
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple module that organizes in a single object a list of proteinogenic amino acids and some of its characteristics. Most of the stored information are important for mass spectrometry based proteomics.

This is an example of how the object is organizied:

    internals: {
        abbreviation           "Ala",
        amino_acid             "Alanine",
        avg_mass               71.0788,
        codons                 "GCU GCC GCA GCG",
        formula                "C3H5NO",
        is_hydrophobic         1,
        is_polar               0,
        monoisotopic_mass      71.03711,
        pH                     "-",
        pI                     6.01,
        pK1                    2.35,
        pK2                    9.87,
        short_name             "A",
        side_chain             "-CH3",
        van_der_waals_volume   67
    }

=head1 METHODS

    $aa->pK1();


=head2 pK2

    The amino acid Dissociation constant (alpha-NH3).
    Note: Pyrrolysine and Selenocysteine have a pK2 of 0, the true value was not setted yet.

    $aa->pK2();

    $aa->is_polar();


=head2 pH

    Returns the amino acids pH.

    $aa->pH();


=head2 Van der Walls Volume

    Returns the approximate Van der Walls volume.
